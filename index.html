<p>
These are the (work in progress) notes I took while taking MIT's 2019 web.lab, formerly called <i>6.148 Web Programming Competition</i>. It is an 8 day workshop that assumes no background, and the goal is to produce a prototype. My learning style is to identify things that I don't understand as I progress, trying secondary sources to elaborate on whatever seems confusing or is hand waved in the slides and lectures, which may be helpful to you and are an example of the kinds of notes you should take yourself when trying to figure out a new subject. We can't possibly learn the entire field of web development in one workshop so this is just a starting point.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MIT's 6.170 <i>Software Studio</i> <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">lectures</a> and slides, or the 2019 <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa19/6.170/materials.html">schedule</a>, for exercises and review which is a more advanced course so optional extra material.</li>
<li>The free <a href="https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/blob/master/README.md">book</a>, <i>Functional-Light JavaScript</i> by Kyle Simpson to help explain some of the 6.170 material.</li>
<li>The 2018 <a href="http://webdevelopment.mit.edu/2018/lectures">schedule</a>, better quality lectures but no React content</li>

As stated in the intro this workshop assumes no background, not even a programming background. You could absolutely follow the web.lab lectures and just hack together a prototype. I'm doing the majority of exercises with <a href="https://eruda.liriliri.io/">Eruda</a>, on a $100 Motorola phone 1hr or so per day and it's been working so far. You can also use Chrome DevTools or FireFox Developer Tools to edit javascript in the console as you read the slides on any desktop browser or use VSCode, screw around with Heroku or AWS free tier, or run node.js locally on your own system.

<p>
A lot of OOP terminology will be used in web.lab and 6.170, it will make much more sense if you do these executable <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/teaching/6170/accelerator/modules/objects/slides.html#/">slides</a> for objects, abstract types, closures, reference aliasing, etc.
These JavaScript slides are self explanatory and you can run/change them in your browser. Arrow down until that section ends, right arrow for next section.
The last exercise probably won't make any sense until you do the course. What it's doing is initializing an empty array 'es', pushing the negative time when the light is green 
and onclick it will push the current (positive) time.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/dlJ442mgGjU">YouTube</a> - IAP 2019 Day 1 - HTML</li>
</ul>


<p>
Html:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is 'nested boxes'</li>
<li>DOCTYPE reason for existence is hand waved. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Investigation reveals doctype <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode">declarations</a> prevent the browser from loading pages in other modes such as 'quirks mode'
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://jkorpela.fi/quirks-mode.html">quirks mode</a> turns out to be a legacy feature to intentionally simulate the bugs of old browsers like IE4/5.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Important: anything written before a doctype declaration may trigger nonstandard behavior</li>
<li>There are now 3 modes: quirks mode, almost standards mode, and a full standards mode. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We will certainly want 'full standards mode' so &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Html tags:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Opening and closing tags to structure the document into containers</li>
<li>Can't violate scope, ie: close a container tag then try and close a tag that was opened inside that now closed container
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If I open a box, and inside are envelopes that I open, I can't then close the box and then expect to close the internal envelopes from outside the box</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reasons for why tags are even used in the first place are in this <a href="http://jkorpela.fi/html-primer.html">primer</a>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The browser throws all newline indicators away and processes the html as a long string as it deems appropriate</li>
<li>Exception: tag &lt;pre&gt; that indicates preformatted so will display as is</li>
<li>Elements represent <i>logical relationships</i> rather than precise physical relationships, because people can alter their browser settings to display the page in a different physical style than what you specify
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ex: bold, underline, italics, may all be displayed differently but the html element for these things simply represents that text should be more prominent in some way</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Clarity: What exactly is a tag vs an element? 
An <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/html-elements.php">element</a> is what the tag represents (semantics) while the tag is syntax. For example the tag &lt;div&gt;, it is markup syntax for 'the Content Division element'. 
If I were to make a new element 'the Supreme Container element' and give it a tag &lt;kjdfj34&gt; &lt;/kjdfj34&gt; it's now clear which is the element and what is markup syntax.    
</p>


<p>
Html head:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>General machine processed information about the page (metadata)
<ul class="org-ul">

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Html body:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Represents what you see (the content)</li>
<li>Heading tags, h1 = 'first order' (top level), h2 is subsection title, h3 etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Html Attributes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Optional attributes are inside the opening tag</li>
<li>Link tags are called 'anchor', prob for obscure netscape navigator reasons</li>
<li>ul, ol and li (list) elements discussion, dissenting opinion <a href="http://jkorpela.fi/html/ul-ol.html">here</a> why ul shouldn't be considered 'unordered'</li>
</ul>

<p>
Not covered, void elements:
The reasons given in the lecture why &lt;img&gt; doesn't have a closing tag were vague. The HTML <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements">standard</a> reveals this is a void element which is not allowed any content, hence no reason for requiring closing(they can still have attributes).

MIT's advice is to 'just google', so I'm going to skim through the actual <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML standard</a>, to clear up these questions like which semantic elements do what, what exactly div is, etc.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The standard insists there is only HTML and no 'HTML5', as the standard is unversioned.</li>
<li>A review of <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#semantics-2">semantics</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Another statement that html markup conveys the meaning, rather than the presentation since the browser can adjust all these things.</li>
<li>There's a comment about using grouping elements like <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-hgroup-element">hgroup</a>, to organize secondary titles when using headings, so they aren't misinterpreted as a seperate section. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is apparently <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hgroup">not</a> adopted by W3C, another standards organization, and MDN claims hgroup is 'theoretical only' linking to a W3C workaround using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/common-idioms-without-dedicated-elements.html#common-idioms-without-dedicated-elements">span</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<p>
We find what we need:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Full table of contents for HTML <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#toc-semantics">elements</a> and their description
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-div-element">div</a> element is strongly encouraged to only be used as last resort, with other semantic tags used instead for accessibility software</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html">&lt;em&gt; element</a> is emphasis, for accessibility readers and other machines parsing html, it subsumes italics element</li>
<li>Span is exampled here as loading a translation attribute in a sentence on a single word</li>
<li>Standard also lists various <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/better-numerical-inputs-for-mobile-forms/">attributes</a> we will want to ensure the [0-9] number keypad pops up on touchscreens. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Not all inputs that contain numbers (credit cards, SS#, etc) should have an input type of number. They are best served up as text inputs, which are still free to use the pattern attribute to pull up the tel keypad on supported devices"</li>
<li>In general the number input should only be used if it's something you're going to do math operations on, you are unlikely to add and subtract account numbers and other numeric identifiers.</li>

Which html standard do we use? W3C forks the WHATWG standard, with <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/FAQ.md">inconsistent</a> updates.

<li>Child elements of div receive the styling of the parent element</li>

<li>We are asked to make a class called text-center in style2.css. Then we are asked to add the class to the div with id=profile-container.

</ul>
<p>
Then I opened profile2.html and inserted &lt;div id="profile-container" class="text-center"&gt; to see if it would work, assuming because this is markup we can add a space and fill in new attributes. It works. I try it on &lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; by pasting in my class attribute: &lt;h4 class="text-center"&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; and it works there too. Finally I see the card class entry: &lt;h3 class="card"&gt; and add a space, inserting my text-center class: &lt;h3 class="card text-center"&gt; and it works as expected.

<div id="outline-container-orgdd17aa5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdd17aa5"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Circle avatar CSS hack</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>profile4.html and profile4.css are an example to display a background image with a circle border.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this seems like a work around/hack and something we would never do in practice</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's attempt to understand what is going on. With Chrome inspector open while displaying profile4.html, click on the div for large-profile-container, 
we see there is green padding on each side of the image and an empty spot exactly where the image is shown. Now examine the div for circle-avatar, the green padding covers exactly where the image is. According to this version of the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/box.html#padding-properties">CSS standard</a> color or images can be
attached to the padding with the background property, which is exactly what is specified in the circle-avatar selector. The border-radius property is obvious, just play with it's values to see how it curves the border.
</p>

<p>
The CSS for large-profile-container contains the line: "padding: 0 40%" which from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding">MDN</a> indicates: "When two values are specified, the first padding applies to the top and bottom, the second to the left and right." Examining the div large-profile-container again
in Chrome inspector, on the bottom right where there is the box model diagram, we scroll down and see the padding-left, and the padding-right values are identical.
What the percentage value has done, is taken the width of the parent div container: profile-container, and multiplied it by 40% to obtain those two values.
Examining the div for circle-avatar (we're still in Chrome inspector btw), the padding-top value is exactly the same as the height of it's parent: large-profile-container because the CSS values for the circle-avatar div contains: padding-top: 100% which means
multiply the height of the top container by 1 (100%) so you get the same value. Note the browser is automatically calculating this, these values will change depending on how you resize your page. 
</p>

<p>
Another use for the background property is assigning a temporary color if you're scaffolding a bunch of containers by hand, just to see the layout.

The example in the lecture of adding a text-center class to everything can also be used as a debug helper, adding a brightly colored outline to html containers to see the container layout more clearly.

<h3 id="org0984b15"><span class="section-number-3">5.3</span> How the cascade works</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
The convention on how overrides are handled were briefly covered, so let's find out what they are and what exactly is cascading. First we look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade#Origin_of_CSS_declarations">MDN</a> which reveals cascading is a process in which the winning declaration is chosen, since we
need to consider both user stylesheets (apparently you can write your own CSS, I've just have been enforcing reader mode everywhere), the browser's default stylesheets, and the author of the website or document CSS. These can all conflict so the cascade determines which styling should 'win'.
MDN doesn't really elaborate on the decision making process and points out the !important rule all 3 (author, user, user-agent(browser)) can use to try and override all other style sheets, and that the user defined style sheet has precedence. It's recommended as a CSS author to never use !important. 
</p>

<p>
Checking google scholar we see there's a CSS thesis by HW Lie. Survey papers and thesis are better than any online tutorial since they will include design decisions.  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let's quickly skim through the <a href="https://www.wiumlie.no/2006/phd/css.pdf">thesis</a></li>
<li>The chapter specific to CSS is chapter 6 so we start there</li>
<li>A few pages about syntax in detail, and a full listing of properties for CSS2</li>
<li>A list of possible values for properties, '3em' which is a number with a unit. 'em and ex' are relative to the font sizes, much like our percentage example which was relative to the parent container this size will be expressed relative to whatever font size the user has selected for their browser/reading assistant.      
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>these number/unit values can also express angles '90deg', time '10ms' (ie: how long to pause) and freq '3kHz' on the aural properties, which are used by screen readers/speech synthesizers.</li>
<li>functions can be values, apparently some properties accept a functional notation when using a string presents a naming conflict.</li>
<li>numerous other values are exampled, there's an interesting formal definition for what a pixel is considered to be in CSS</li>
<li>space or comma seperated multiple values are fine</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
An interesting statement about properties and their settings: "Nearly every CSS property has different rules for the values on its right-hand side and it is not much of an exaggeration to say that each property's right-hand side has its own specialized language" 
</p>

<p>
This leads into inconsistent percentage values which we already ran into with the CSS-avatar hack:  "Percentage values are similar to relative length units in
the sense that they are relative to another value. Each property that accepts a percentage value also defines to what other value the percentage is relative. Most
percentage values refer to width of the closest block-level ancestor but some refer to other values, for example, the font size of the parent element."  
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Value propagation aka Cascading begins in Chapter 6.5.1
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3 principal mechanisms for propagation: cascading, inheritance and initial values 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the cascade is a 'negotiation' between 3 parties (author, agent, user-agent(browser)) to ensure all element/property combinations have a value</li>
<li>if the cascading process doesn't yield a value, the parent element's value will be used</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By default author declarations (the person who wrote the CSS) wins over user settings unless user marks !important in their style declarations</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Interesting note</b>: the thesis author considered a scenario where users could all share style sheets for different sites on a peer-to-peer basis, too bad this didn't become a mainstream thing where I can use a browser extension and flip through dozens of competing designs for various sites.</li>
<li>The section on creating boxes from elements describes the parsing process, making a tree, etc. It also suggests implementations can optimize processing by doing several steps in parallel
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Apparently Stylo in Firefox's Quantum browser parallelizes their CSS rendering implementation. TODO: look at this implementation sometime</li>
<li>Design decisions are described for the '3 band' box model in CSS of Margin, Border and Padding. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>note that negative values can be used for margin, to overlap boxes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

The rest of the thesis is put on hold since we'll learn positioning in the upcoming lecture 'Advanced CSS'.

CSS grid is 'two dimensional' whereas Flexbox layout is 'one dimensional'. The standard gives this <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#intro">example</a> of the difference, but it seems like CSS grid
can reference all of row/column at the same time (adjust height, grow the row past the current row into another) and overlap elements, where Flexbox can only reference a single row/column at a time.

<li>Pitfalls with CSS Grid: The legacy mobile browsers still out there on old devices, and IE version 10 and 11 which refuses to die.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's a <a href="https://medium.com/@elad/supporting-css-grid-in-internet-explorer-b38669e75d66">workaround</a> for IE using Autoprefixer CSS online, but you could also use javascript to check browser version and present a more barebones page for IE until it finally goes away.</li>
<li>Major pitfall: Chrome is coming up with their own <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uxbDh4uONFQOiGuiumlJBLGgO4KDWB8ZEkp7Rd47fw4/edit">layoutNG</a> to replace CSS</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's start with the canonical resource for these things (that will tell us what is implemented) which is MDN.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We begin to read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout">MDN web docs</a> basic concepts of grid layout
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>all the examples can be done in one html file, resize your browser window when you check the changes to see how grid is responsive to your window resizing:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre class="example">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
 .wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;One&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Two&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Three&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Four&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Five&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So far this is all pretty straight forward, the value 'fr' represents a porportion of whatever space is left inside a container, so 1fr and 2fr represents 1/3 and 2/3 avail space.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2fr and 1fr is translated as: "this is twice as big as the other"</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/minmax">minmax()</a> function can also be input to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/repeat">repeat()</a> as a parameter
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>repeat() parameters are repeat(num-of-repeats, the-values-to-repeat)</li>
<li>repeat(4, 1fr) will create: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr</li>
<li>repeat(2, 10px 1fr) will create: 10px 1fr 10px 1fr</li>
<li>repeat(2, minmax(100px, auto)) will create 2 tracks sized of min value 100px, and max value set to auto.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The rest of the MDN page on basic concepts of grid layout are self explanatory, overlapping boxes and using property z-index to declare their display priority over other boxes, and refers to other guides with layout examples we can look at when we actually start building something.</li>

<p>
Let's skim through the CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1">candidate recommendation</a>. The 2018 Module 2 standard W3C published is just an addon to define <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-css-grid-2-20180804/">subgrids</a> and is still a working draft, so we'll read it after. An example of subgrids is given <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/css-grid-2/">here</a>.  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We begin to read the candidate <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-css-grid-1-20171214/">recommendation</a> for CSS Grid</li>
<li>Mentioned are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">media queries</a>, these are attributes you can add to your stylesheet declarations to test for certain display properties, like display aspect ratio, of the user viewing the page, and then assign them a specific stylesheet for their device. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-css-grid-1-20171214/#source-independence">example</a> of media queries, if orientation is landscape present the following grid, if portrait, present this other grid configuaration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Motivation for grid was to replace the hacky workarounds of tables and floating elements for application layouts.</li>
<li>First example using a game screen is self explanatory, and actually a better explanation than the MDN docs</li>
<li>Grid layout is precisely defined <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-css-grid-1-20171214/#grid-concepts">here</a> describing 'block axis' (column) and 'inline axis' (row).</li>
<li>There's a warning about "correct source ordering" which is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_Layout_and_Accessibility#Re-ordering_content_in_CSS_Grid_Layout">defined</a> by MDN, basically keeping the HTML semantic source logical and only using CSS grid to reorder the content visually, so a screen reader and other software can still interpret your html.</li>
<li><b>Important</b> we can give <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#named-lines">names</a> to columns and rows
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Another article about <a href="https://vgpena.github.io/using-css-grid-the-right-way/">naming</a>, to make the CSS more flexible, same article also recommends using porportions (the fr value), instead of specific values/percentages</li>
</ul></li>

The rest of the CSS grid spec goes into fine details about positioning like 'gutters' the term for space between grid boxes. We'll come back to these when we do the advanced CSS lecture.

MDN has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Realizing_common_layouts_using_CSS_Grid_Layout">guide</a> to common layouts using CSS Grid, that use semantic html elements. Seems like there are a dozen different ways to write CSS grid stylesheets, like using wrappers (injecting some class
named .wrapper into a div element, then using .wrapper as a selector to build a grid). We should probably look at some real world examples and not tutorials to see how this is done.

Let's try to figure out a page's CSS. I have chosen Stripe's website, specifically the <a href="https://stripe.com/payments">payments</a> marketing page because there's all kinds of things going on like skewed grids, and animations.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A list of interesting things:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Smartphone screenshot image labelled 'kickstarter' has been transformed/rotated to adjust <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJGmX83MNUY">perspective</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>transform: translate(-50%,-50%) rotate3d(.5,.866,0,16deg) rotateZ(-2deg); 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>transformations are described <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#TranslateDefined">here</a>, to understand this you need a few lectures from this <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs053/current/lectures.htm">course</a> or wait until the Advanced CSS lecture.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the '$25' overlayed on the phone image is a span element that has also been transformed: scale(var(&#x2013;device-scale)) translate(54px,620px)</li>
<li>&#x2013;device-scale is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQUB039MG0I">CSS variable</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Navigation up top is also using some kind of transformations, to slow/smooth the display of the next menu option. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/translateX">translateX()</a> seems to accomplish this, instead of disappearing and producing a new window, it shifts the old window horizontally with some kind of delay for smoothness/effect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Animations used for the 'recent updates' boxes, and shadowing for effects
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These cards seem to be stacked boxes overlaying each other, with shadow effects on their borders, animated using the translateY() function, so like the navigation menus that shifted right, these are shifting up with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-delay">transition-delay</a> property</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The images for 'Grow Faster' and 'Developer-Centric' are interactive
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's using an event listener, which we haven't learned yet</li>
<li>Again we see there are translateX() function transformation w/delays, in incremental negative values,  to give it a smooth transformation from right to left.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Background looks like an affine grid plane, which is equally spaced parallel lines in two different directions, with some parts colored to make stripes
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>see below</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's mimic the stripes. Inspecting any part of the page in Firefox or Chrome Developer Tools, click on the div with class "lower-page" and then it's child div with class "grid" to see the grid, on the right
hand side under layout. Clicking on each grid reveals it's construction, the slanted grid lines to paint the stripes look interesting. I try: transform: skewY(-0.06turn) (which I found in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/skewY">MDN</a> documentation). 
Then I try to color the d d d area background, using shorthand grid-area values: selecting grid row 2, column 1, spanning 'only grid 2' (unsure about grid-row-end), and going from column line 1 (far left of grid) over 4 column lines to create a similar effect, a background colored stripe on the page. 
Changing these values helps to understand them, except 'grid-row-end', which doesn't act like I think it should when I change it's value from 1 to 3. Looking at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_grid-row-end2">this</a> I now get what it does. We can also change the value to span 2 or span 3 to create a thicker stripe. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;!-- creating background stripe grid test --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);

     transform: skewY(-0.06turn);
}
.box1 {
grid-area: 2 / 1 / 2 / 4;
background-color: lightblue;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

JS functions: This <a href="https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/blob/master/manuscript/ch2.md/#chapter-2-the-nature-of-functions">chapter</a> helps to explain things like arbitrary numbers of arguments. Multi-argument functions in most languages are really single-argument functions that take a tuple as an argument.
</p>

<pre class="example">
// declared with a name, arguments(parameters) and a body
function multiply(a, b) {
   return a * b;
}

//can take a variable number of arguments that don't have to be specified, access these with array index notation
function multiply() {
   return arguments[0] * arguments[1];
}


//arguments can have default values
function multiply(a, b = 1) {
   return a * b;
}

//functions are values, can be assigned to variables
let multiply = function(a,b) {
   return a * b;
}

//can be passed as arguments, ie: first class functions
let toys = [
 {name: "Woody", price: 10},
 {name: "Rex", price: 3}];

toys =
   toys.filter(function(toy) {
      return toy.price &lt; 9;});

<li>list.filter(function(item) { &#x2026; });
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>filter function that tests each element of the array and constructs a new array from whatever values pass the filter</li>
</ul></li>
<li>map also available in js: list.map(function(item) { &#x2026; }) which applies a function to every element, returning a new array</li>
<li>list.reduce also available for a single output value, using an accumulator: list.reduce(function, init);</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Clarity: JS arrays look and act like lists, but are just high level objects, not actually linked lists (or even real arrays for that matter).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-3">
<p>
This chapter on <a href="https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/blob/master/manuscript/ch7.md/#chapter-7-closure-vs-object">closures vs object</a> will clarify these slides. 
</p>

<p>
There's an example on slide #62 of pairs(list1, list2, f) function being passed another function as an argument in order to encapsulate the iteration and provide the ability to
reference items instead of direct array indices to avoid mistakes. Closures are then covered, using a higher-order function which is a function that returns another function. If you're reading the slides in say, chrome or firefox pdf reader, 
right click inspect element or inspector, click on console and enter the code you see to understand what it's doing. Type 'hello;' into the console to see it's
construction: f(msg){ console.log(prefix + msg);} which is how hello("arvind"); works.  There's an explanation of closures <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7464475">here</a> but for clarity let's refer to <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/isml/book.pdf">PSML</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
..the concept of a closure, a technique for implementing higher-order functions.  When a function expression is evaluated, a copy of the environment is attached to the function.  Subsequently, all free variables of the function (i.e., those variables not occurring as parameters)
are resolved with respect to the environment attached to the function; the function is therefore said to be “closed” with respect to the attached environment. This is achieved at function application time by “swapping” the attached environment of the
function for the environment active at the point of the call.  The swapped environment  is  restored  after  the  call  is  complete.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
There's a memoization exercise in the slides. What it's doing is cacheing the previous computations in a data structure.
When you use it for Fibonacci as in the example: memoizedFib(40), the memoized function calls fib(40), and stores the result in the array we declared. The next time you use that function, memoizedFib(40)
to call fib(40) again it will look up the entry for index 40 in the array and then produce that previous value instead of having to do exponential work calling fib(40) all over again. Note that it is a generic memoization function, anything else that maps from one input to one output (like
calculating factors, or primes) can use the same memoization function, such as newfactor = memoized(factor) or fastprime = memoized(sieve).

<h2 id="orgbb5f7b1"><span class="section-number-2">12</span> [6.170] JavaScript: DOM Manipulation exercises and review</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-12">
<p>
The first part of these <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/courseMaterial/topics/topic4/lectureNotes/3_-_js-dom-events/3_-_js-dom-events.pdf">slides</a> cover OOP constructors such as Prototypes, which are explained <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_prototypes.asp">here</a>. I don't think either course has fully described what the document object model(DOM) is, so we'll look at the standard for it later.  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Slide #37 we come to DOM manipulation 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We can select a DOM node w/selectors (except pseudo-classes like caption:hover):
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>document.querySelector("#header"), document.querySelectorAll(".caption")</li>
<li>Note these are CSS selectors, so everything we learned in CSS about selectors can be applied here</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An element is a DOM node that corresponds to an html tag like &lt;p&gt; or &lt;h1&gt;</li>
<li>A node is a generic DOM node class for text, comments, etc.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>element.tagName, element.id, element.innerHTML, node.nodeType, node.nodeValue</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Manipulating properties: element.style.color = "blue";, element.style.borderRadius = "10px";</li>
<li>Caveats: string cat has poor perf due to browser has to parse the string then reconstruct DOM subtree
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>cannot insert element between two others, can't return references to new elements</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>The slides walk through an example of adding a new link to the tree after h1:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>let link = document.createElement("a"); (create a new element)</li>
<li>link.href = "<a href="http://eecs.mit.edu">http://eecs.mit.edu</a>"; (create internal .href property)</li>
<li>let label = document.createTextNode("EECS"); (create a new DOM/tree label)</li>
<li>link.appendChild(label); (append the label to 'a')</li>
<li>let body = document.querySelector("body"); (grab the body DOM tree object, assign it to a variable for manipulation)</li>
<li>body.appendChild(link); (append our new 'a' node to body)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inserting before a node:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>let newChild = document.createElement("p");  (create a new element again called p)</li>
<li>let parent = document.querySelector("body"); (create a variable called parent that represents the html body)</li>
<li>let sibling = document.querySelector("h1"); (create a sibling variable, select the element 'h1')</li>
<li>parent.insertBefore(newChild, sibling); (insert our new element p before h1)</li>
<li>parent.replaceChild(newChild, sibling);</li>
<li>parent.removeChild(newChild, sibling);</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are multiple methods to traverse the tree: .previousSibling, .nextSibling, .nextElementSibling, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7ef308e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7ef308e"><span class="section-number-3">12.1</span> DOM manipulation exercise</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-1">
<p>
We're asked to go to example.com, open the console, write three ways to select the "More information" link, one of which must be a traversal,
and inside the white box add a third paragraph of text. Finally add a 2nd level heading before the paragraph we added. They have different solutions in the slides, notably the ('p &gt; a') selector and using .children to walk the tree. 
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Select &lt;a&gt; directly:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>let link = document.querySelector("a");</li>
<li>link.href</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Traverse to &lt;a&gt;:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>let parent = document.querySelector('p'); (grabs the first paragraph above the link)</li>
<li>let traverse = parent.nextElementSibling;</li>
<li>traverse.firstElementchild.href</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another way to select the href: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>let b = document.querySelectorAll('p');</li>
<li>this selects every 'p' and places into a NodeList, which we can access using array notation []:</li>
<li>b[​1].firstElementChild.href</li>
<li>b[​1].innerHTML also reveals the link</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let's add a paragraph:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>let firstP = document.querySelector('p'); (grabs first paragraph)</li>
<li>let newChild = document.createElement('p'); (create a new &lt;p&gt;)</li>
<li>firstP.appendChild(newChild);</li>
<li>newChild.innerText = "Here's another paragraph"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let's add the second level heading:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>let newHeading = document.createElement('h2');</li>
<li>firstP.insertBefore(newHeading, newChild);</li>
<li>newHeading.innerText = "This is a new Heading";</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Let's finish the <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/courseMaterial/topics/topic4/lectureNotes/3_-_js-dom-events/3_-_js-dom-events.pdf">slides</a> from 6.170, starting on slide #77 for JavaScript events. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>JS is single threaded</li>
<li>blocking is a problem for long running operations</li>
<li>JS has a trad call stack and a message queue for events such as clicks, timers, etc.</li>
<li>when the call stack is empty, the event loop evals FIFO (first in, first out)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Running their example shows how events (timeouts) are deferred:
</p>
<pre class="example">
function one() {
 console.log("one");
 setTimeout(two, 0);
 console.log("three");
 setTimeout(four, 0);
 console.log("five");
}
function two() {
 console.log("two");
}
function four() {
 console.log("four");
}
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>setTimeout(function() {&#x2026;}, ms); 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Executes the given function after a min delay in milliseconds</li>
</ul></li>
<li>let timerID = setInterval(function() {&#x2026;}, ms);
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Executes the given function at a given interval in milliseconds</li>
<li>clearInterval(timerID) to stop the timer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Listening for interaction events:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>let elem = document.querySelector("h1");</li>
<li>elem.addEventListener("click", function(event) {&#x2026;});</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Browser creates events + adds them to the queue when h1 is clicked</li>
<li>When the event is processed from the queue, the registered listener function is called.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="orgab257e4"><span class="section-number-2">14</span> [weblab] Workshop 1: Client Side Javascript + Async</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-14">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We're working with git clone <a href="https://github.com/mit6148-workshops/catbook-workshop1.git">https://github.com/mit6148-workshops/catbook-workshop1.git</a></li>
<li>Slide #8 questions: Let's walk through api.js since they only give a brief description.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, see these <a href="http://www.datasciencecourse.org/slides/data_collection.pdf">slides</a> starting on slide#6 about url parameters from a CMU data science course.</li>
<li>From the slides: You've seen URLs like these: google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;source=web&#x2026;</li>
<li>Everything after ? is parameters given to the google api. The '&amp;' character seperates them.</li>
<li>Read the rest of the slides about REST APIs, JSON data</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
api.js explained:
</p>
<pre class="example">
function get(endpoint, params, successCallback, failureCallback)
  These parameters are:
   - endpoint = the base URL ie: https://google.com
   - params = whatever you want to send to the API "userID=1000"
   - successCallback, failureCallback = optional functions that you define/pass as args 

 const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
   We're making a constant variable xhr, and assigning to it a new object XMLHttpRequest().
   You can try this in the console: const temp = new XMLHttpRequest() then type temp; to look at the object.
   MDN has a full list of all it's 'methods', such as XMLHttpRequest.getResponseHeader(); 

 const fullPath = endpoint + '?' + formatParams(params);
   Creates constant variable fullPath which will be baseURL + ? + parameters
   Example: fullPath = https://google.com/?userID=1000
   Note, another function is called, formatParams(params) which encodes the parameters using encodeURIComponent()
    - This is basically to escape characters using UTF-8 encoding

  xhr.open('GET', fullPath, true);
   Explained here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/open
   The boolean is an optional parameter that defaults to true because you don't want synchronous requests
    - Synchronous meaning your script has to wait for a reply, possibly freezing the user's browser
  
  xhr.onload = function(err) {
    if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
      if (xhr.status === 200) {
        if (successCallback)
          successCallback(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText));
      } else {
        if (failureCallback)
        failureCallback(xhr.statusText);}}}
   
    Here is where our optional functions are. If the request returns http status 200 (OK) then 
    the if-branch tests if you actually gave a success function as an argument, if(successCallback) determines if that parameter exists.
    If you did, then it calls your function with args (JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)), if you didn't then nothing is run. 

    In the workshop the successCallback function is: function(stories) { console.log(stories) };
    This will populate the console with xhr.responseText, which is then parsed by JSON.parse: 
    function(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)) { console.log(the output of JSON.parse) };
      
    Try this yourself in the console, giving no success/failure function: 
     const API_ENDPOINT_START = 'http://google-catbook.herokuapp.com';
     let atest = get(API_ENDPOINT_START + "/api/stories", {});
     atest; (undefined)
    
    This is what the slides mean by 'nothing is returned' by the get/post functions, unless you specify success and failure functions in 
    the params. 

  xhr.send(null);
    This is explained here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15123839/why-do-we-pass-null-to-xmlhttprequest-send
</pre>

<p>
Let's also look at their function formatParams():
</p>

<pre class="example">
 function formatParams(params) {
  return Object
    .keys(params)
    .map(function(key) {
      return key+'='+encodeURIComponent(params[key])
    })
    .join('&amp;');
}
  First, they have broken up the return line for readability: 
   return Object.keys(params).map(function(key){ return key+'='+encodeURIComponent(params[key]) }).join('&amp;');

  encodeURIComponent() you can look up on MDN, it's escaping characters. 
  Object.keys() you can also look up on MDN, it's returning an array of keys:
   
   let params2 = {}; //empty dict
   params2.userID = "100";
   params2.name = "Bob";
   console.log(Object.keys(params2));
    -&gt; (2) ["userID", "name"]

  let test = Object.keys(params2);
  test[0];
   -&gt; "userID"
  params2["userID"]
   -&gt; "100"
  
 So the return value is print the key, concat '=' with the UTF-8 encoded value of params["key"], and join them with '&amp;':
 formatParams(params2);
   -&gt; "userID=100&amp;name=Bob"
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>More talk/slides about async vs synchronous behavior
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>clicking on Network while in Chrome Inspector lists the get reqs queue/history</li>
<li>Guaranteeing order: nested requests/callbacks</li>
<li>Design around callback hell of deeply nested get requests</li>
</ul></li>
<li>First task is to add renderStories() to index.js, and then fill in the skeleton in feed.js for renderstories()
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We can see that in index.js there's a main function, underneath where the navbar is rendered add: renderStories();</li>
<li>Then in feed.js complete function renderStories() with simple output to console
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Refresh index.html and look at the console, the object filled with stories should be there.</li>
<li>you would have console.log(a = stories) if you wanted it bound to a variable to play around with</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
I tried a different version of renderStories() than the lectures:
</p>
<pre class="example">
function renderStories() {
    let newDiv = document.getElementById("stories");
       
    get(API_ENDPOINT_START + "/api/stories", {}, function(stories) {
        stories.map(story =&gt; newDiv.prepend(storyDOMObject(story)) )});
}
</pre>

<p>
I also wrote mine so comments so would be pulled while inside StoryDOMObject function since the needed JSON id field to fetch the comments is in scope. Of course in production you would never do this because of possible
failures of comment API, which we aren't even handling by omitting the failureCallBack arguments. You likely wouldn't design api.js like they did either.
</p>

<pre class="example">
function storyDOMObject(storyJSON) {

    const storyDiv = document.createElement('section');
    storyDiv.setAttribute('id', storyJSON._id);
    storyDiv.className = 'story';

    const cardBody = document.createElement('article');
    cardBody.className = ('story-content');
    cardBody.innerText = storyJSON.content
    storyDiv.appendChild(cardBody);

    const creator = document.createElement('footer');
    creator.className = ('story-creator');
    creator.innerText = storyJSON.creator_name
    cardBody.appendChild(creator);

    get(API_ENDPOINT_START + "/api/comment", {parent: storyJSON._id}, function(comments) {
        comments.map( comment =&gt; creator.append(commentDOMObject(comment)) ) }); 

    return storyDiv;
}
</pre>

<p>
You'll probably have to change the default CSS, adding some background color to the comments and stories helps distinguish them as
the default CSS is terrible.

<h2 id="orge24508e"><span class="section-number-2">15</span> The Document Object Model (DOM) API standard</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-15">
<p>
Let's find out what the DOM API actually is. This spec should be what most browsers have implemented but of course we'd actually have to manually check each browser's documentation. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We begin to read through the WHATWG DOM <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/">spec</a> 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it's another 'living standard', so unversioned, it keeps adding features and stays the same name. This means you can't find definitive implementations "This browser fully conforms to DOM API v5.1".</li>
<li>Some standard architecture on trees, ordered sets, selectors, namespaces</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DOM Events:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We already know some of this, except for synthetic events: applications dispatching events themselves
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Whoever wrote this filled it with old memes, the absolute state of current year standards documents</li>
<li>Sometimes when you click on a definition it navigates via URL fragment to the same paragraph you're already reading</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The entire interface for Event is shown, and a list of methods, plus CustomEvent, EventTarget.   
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Interesting note: browsers need to use special legacy pre-activation/cancel algorithms to implement checkbox and radio input elements</li>
<li>Another interesting note about dispatching event listeners, for example old DOM api's implementing touch and wheel events which blocked the async scrolling</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There's a very long step by step spec for how browser's can dispatch an event</li>
<li>In firing events, initializing  IDL attributes are mentioned: IDL is Interface Definition Language/Web IDL spec.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Firing in DOM context: creating, initializing, and dispatching an event.</li>
<li>Important: An event signifies an occurence, not an 'action'. They don't start an algorithm they influence an ongoing one with notifications.</li>
<li>A section on capture and bubbling, events traverse the tree towards the root in order to find a handler in most cases, in special or defined cases, events start at the root and move towards the event target (the originating tree node), to find a handler.</li>
<li>Shadow DOM is also specified, it's a DOM object for things normally not selectable in 'light' DOM, such as play buttons for &lt;video&gt;&lt;/video&gt;.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
We finally arrive at 'Introduction to The DOM' in section 4
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As we knew markup goes in, a tree filled with HTML elements is constructed in the browser
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's a <a href="https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/">DOM Viewer</a> which is somewhat more clear than Chrome DevTools</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A document tree is described, and tree order</li>
<li>A lot of notes on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot">HTML slots</a></li>
<li>A large section on how insertion/pre-insertion algorithms work</li>
<li>We get a list of methods we can run on collections, elements and nodes: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>node.children returns child elements (seen in the 6.170 slides)</li>
<li>node.firstElementChild returns the first child that is an element or null otherwise</li>
<li>node.lastElementChild returns the last child that's an element or null</li>
<li>briefly reading skimming the DOM options to see what's available</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A collection is an object that represents a list of nodes, like NodeList which we already saw or HTMLCollection
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NodeList has various methods: NodeList.length, NodeList.item(index), NodeList[index]</li>
<li>HTMLCollection and NodeList are old-style collections/depreciated, they could disappear from browser APIs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There's mutation observers we can use to log or run callbacks whenever a target mutation occurs</li>
<li>node.CloneNode([deep = true]) will clone the node and return all it's descendants</li>
<li>.createHTMLDocument(title) returns a document w/basic tree constructed including a title
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>useful for generating HTML should we ever want to do that</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A useless feature: hasFeature() originally would report if the user agent supported a given DOM feature, but was so
unreliable they depreciated it with hasFeature() = true by default to not break legacy pages.</li>
<li>Element nodes are just elements
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Long list of intersting element methods:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>insertAdjacent method returns nothing because 'it existed before we had a chance to design it'</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Introduction to "DOM Ranges"
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Range objects represent a sequence of content within a node tree.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
In this example we are cutting/concatenating the two text lines into "syndata is awes":
</p>

<pre class="example">
//Tree:
    Element: p
        Element: &lt;img src="insanity-wolf" alt="Little-endian BOM; decode as big-endian!"&gt;
        Text:  CSS 2.1 syndata is 
        Element: &lt;em&gt;
            Text: awesome 
        Text: ! 

//Range example:
var range = new Range(),
    firstText = p.childNodes[1],
    secondText = em.firstChild
range.setStart(firstText, 9) // do not forget the leading space
range.setEnd(secondText, 4)
// range now stringifies to the aforementioned quote
</pre>

<p>
The rest of the document covers Traversal interfaces/methods, which we already saw except NodeFilter which we can
use to iterate over NodeIterator and TreeWalker objects and filter results.

<div id="outline-container-org068f423" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org068f423"><span class="section-number-3">15.1</span> The DOM explained via example</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-15-1">
<p>
After reading the spec, the DOM we now know is literally the HTML document, modelled as a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/constructing-the-object-model">tree</a>. Events are (usually) initiated by the user-agent 
(browser) and will in most cases, propagate up the tree by 'bubbling' until the event finds a handler that is listening for it. Since the DOM is the HTML, any
attributes can be set, and document elements manipulated except for the <i>shadow tree</i> which are elements that are normally not able to be captured, such as the play button on &lt;video&gt; elements.   
</p>


<p>
For example let's look at HTML video. See this question/solution <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49414947">here</a> with the problem trying to get a local .vtt subtitle file to load in a browser. Note that browsers have security settings
to prevent any loading of local files unless you manually override these settings. The solution was to encode the subtitles in the page as
data and then create a URL object to attach to the &lt;track&gt; element as the new source of the subtitles. 
</p>

<p>
The original HTML for embedding the video, to display locally that failed:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt;video controls preload="none" width="800" height="600" poster="test.jpg"&gt;
&lt;source src="test.mp4" type='video/mp4' /&gt;
&lt;track kind="subtitles" src="test_EN.vtt" srclang="en" label="English"&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
&lt;track kind="subtitles" src="test_FR.vtt" srclang="fr" label="French"&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The solution was to give &lt;track&gt; an id, select it with Javascript, and fill in the &lt;track&gt; attributes to point to the raw data subtitles:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt;video controls&gt;
  &lt;source type="video/mp4" src="videoFile.mp4"&gt;
  &lt;track id="subtitle" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var subtitle = "V0VCVlRUDQoNCjENCjAwOjAwOjI4Ljg5NSAtLT4g...";
subtitle = window.atob(subtitle);
var subBlob = new Blob([subtitle]);
var subURL = URL.createObjectURL(subBlob);

document.getElementById("subtitle").setAttribute("src", subURL);
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Since the DOM is the document modelled a different way, we can set the src to a new URL object that points to the data. In fact you could leave off all HTML attributes:  &lt;track id="EnglishTrack"&gt; and fill in the rest of the missing attributes by attaching them to that element in the DOM. If you were to open this in your browser, and enable in DevTool settings: "show user agent shadow DOM" you would see the shadow tree in Chrome DevTools for the &lt;video&gt; element how it
renders for play buttons and other media controls.

<li>Many security considerations, the 6.170 course will likely cover some of these like malicious code injected into package dependencies and package change of ownership via selling to some adtech or other shady outfit. You have to carefully control when you update any packages (lockfiles).</li>
<li>Dependency complexity, npm packages are often micro modules so a package can have hundreds of <a href="https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/purescript">dependencies</a>

Exercise, use express-session. We haven't covered this yet, I mainly went through github <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session">documentation</a>. 
There is a web.lab lecture later on authentication, this is hacky unsafe auth for playing around purposes:
</p>

<pre class="example">
//add session middleware to app.js
const session = require('express-session');
app.use(session({ secret: 'dontUseInProduction'}));

//update routes/user.js to set the user's username in the session
//this is prob wrong, it worked anyway
router.post('/signin', (req, res) =&gt; {
    const sess = req.session;
    sess.username = req.body.username;
    res.write('Hello'+ sess.username);
    res.end('done');
});

//update routes/shorts.js to use the session username and populate creator field
//You add req.session.username anywhere there is a Shorts object being updated
router.post('/', (req, res) =&gt; {
  if (Shorts.findOne(req.body.name) !== undefined) {
    res.status(400).json({
      error: `Short URL ${req.body.name} already exists.`,
    }).end();
  } else {
      const short = Shorts.addOne(req.body.name, req.body.url, req.session.username);
    res.status(200).json(short).end();
  }
});
</pre>

<p>
Step 6, we're asked to try/think about ways our toy url-shortener is insecure. For example anybody can rewrite the url's to redirect to their malicious
ad site, and nothing is validated by our api. To see how to do this go through some of the SEI CERT coding standards for other languages
how they <a href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/IDS52-J.+Prevent+code+injection">whitelist inputs</a> or look at the documentation of validate.js

This is a course about designing and building a disk storage db management system, but we're going to audit the first couple of lectures. 
Some set notation for relational algebra is used, this can be learned from Chapter 2.1 of this free <a href="https://infinitedescent.xyz/dl/infdesc.pdf">book</a> or watch some of this <a href="https://youtu.be/59WX2V7Vjgg">lecture</a>, or read through
this brief <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Set">tutorial</a>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lecture starts around 18:30</li>
<li>Some talk about problems of flat file/csv data implementations</li>
<li>'Relation' means a table</li>
<li>A schema is a definition of what you're storing in the db</li>
<li>A record (row) is a tuple, when you declare a function in a programming language (ex: def fun(x, y)) the parameters are also a tuple</li>
<li>An attribute (column)</li>
<li>In the example for primary keys, the entire key is Artist(id, name, year, country) not just the id number</li>
<li>Foreign key is an attribute from one relation that maps to another relation (a different table)</li>
<li>Relational Algebra is based on sets (union, intersection, difference)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Select: filter (\(\sigma\) sigma) in SQL: where clause</li>
<li>Projection: reorder/manipulate values (\(\Pi\) pi) in SQL: SELECT bid-100, aid, FROM R (select operator)</li>
<li>Union: R \(\cup\) R concatenate sets in SQL: UNION ALL</li>
<li>Intersection: R \(\cap\) R contains only the set that appear in both relations, in SQL: INTERSECT</li>
<li>Difference: R - S a relation that contains only the tuples in the first and not the second relation in SQL: EXCEPT
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>relations must have exact same type/attributes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Product: R x S a cartesian product, in SQL: CROSS JOIN
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>give all unique combinations/configurations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Joins: R \(\bowtie\) S generates all tuples that have a common value, in SQL: NATURAL JOIN

<li>similar to difference except attributes can be different/not shared between both relations</li>

<p>
His observations on performance/declarative way of doing queries are interesting, which lead into the reasons for SQL existing how it will
generally be preferred to just do high level queries "Give me this answer" and let the dbms figure out the most optimized way to do so instead of 
giving a specific sequence of instructions.

<li><a href="https://youtu.be/6VCHuLqfmV8">YouTube</a> - Advanced SQL (Same 2019 playlist)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's learn something more than basic SQL, and see how doing simple things are difficult since no dbms follows the 1992 SQL standard, it's much like the
HTML, CSS and DOM standards we looked at where every browser has a different implementation.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Query optimizing is shilled as a high demand skill</li>
<li>SQL name exists because IBM was sued for calling their prototype 'SEQUEL' 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Structured English Query Language</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Current standard: SQL:2016
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nobody actually follows the standard, except SQL-92 standard</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SQL is a collection of relational languages 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DML: Data Manipulation Lang: insert/update/select</li>
<li>DDL: Data Definition Lang: define schemas</li>
<li>DCL: Data Control Lang: security auth</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Important: SQL is based on 'bag algebra'. No ordering, allows for duplicates.</li>
<li><b>Aggregates</b>: take a bag of tuples, return a single value</li>
<li>ex: AVG (average), MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT = the # of values</li>
<li>Aggregate functions can only be used in the SELECT (filter) output list since you need to select first before running functions on said selection</li>
<li>GROUP BY: Extract information about the aggregates we're computing</li>
<li>HAVING: filters results from aggregates ie: only show me gpa &gt; 3.0 whereas the aggregate is calculating the avg of all gpas</li>
<li><b>Strings</b>:</li>
<li>Single quotes, usually case sensitive (except MySQL)</li>
<li>LIKE is used for string matching '%' matches any substring (including empty), underscore matches any character</li>
<li>SQL-92 standard defines numerous other string functions, operations like || (cat)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Postgres and Oracle most closely follow the SQL-92 standard</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Output Control</b></li>
<li>We can dump the output to another table, if that table doesn't exist then our dbms will create it for us
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>again it's a declarative language, you tell it what you want, the system does it for you</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can limit the tuple output, or order it with ORDER BY</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now we are covering what Prof Pavlo considers advanced SQL, such as nested queries. Everything in this lecture is documented in standards and dbms
documentation, we'll just look at the high level overview for these queries. Have the <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/slides/02-advancedsql.pdf">slides</a> open as you watch the lecture, pause to understand them then continue as he races through these topics in the lectures.
</p>

<p>
-<b>Nested Queries</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>queries inside of queries, take the output of one query use it as the input to another
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>query optimizers may rewrite the example query as a join</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ALL: every tuple must satisfy expression</li>
<li>ANY: must satisfy for at least one row</li>
<li>IN: equivalent to '=ANY()' (is there any tuple that equals my predicate)</li>
<li>EXISTS: at least one row is returned
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>can be combined w/boolean: NOT EXISTS (nothing is returned)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can only reference outer query from inside query, not other way around</li>
</ul>

<p>
Numerous examples of nested queries are shown, and different ways to rewrite them. The high level as already stated you're taking
the output of one query and using it as input to another. 
</p>

<p>
-<b>Window Functions</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Computing some function on tuples, like Aggregates but returns the tuple(s) and the value</li>
<li>SELECT &#x2026; FUNC-NAME(..) OVER(&#x2026;)</li>
<li>OVER() clause specifies how to slice up data (or sort it), can also leave blank</li>
<li>PARITION BY to specify how to group things,  OVER(PARTITION BY ..)</li>
<li>OVER (ORDER BY ..) sorting results
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>RANK() produces the rank of the sort order</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
He goes over examples of this, you can open up a local sqlite3 or postgres install and try these queries yourself.

<h4 id="org61f9fa7"><span class="section-number-4">19.2.1</span> Common Table Expressions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-19-2-1">
<p>
The last example are Common Table Expressions. I made this it's own sub-heading because you'll definitely run into CTEs in the wild.
The ideal scenario is to strive to compute your answer as a single SQL statement as opposed to multiple statements, because then the dbms can do optimizations behind the scenes for you. With CTEs you can
declare 'here's everything I want to do' in a single statement. He also gives an example of recursive CTEs.
</p>

<pre class="example">
WITH cteName AS (
  SELECT 1
)
SELECT * FROM cteName
</pre>

<p>
This creates a temporary table that the SELECT below the 'WITH .. AS' can reference like it was an already existing table.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-19-3">
<p>
In later versions of 15-445, Prof Pavlo eliminated the lecture on normal forms entirely, mainly because 'people just wing it, and end up with 3rd Normal Form anyway".
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/ltMB_dyhxqk">YouTube</a> - Normal Forms (2017 Playlist)
</p>

<p>
The first 10 minutes are a review of the prev lecture, which we skipped about lossless joins, dependency preservation, and avoiding redundancy while performing decomposition. 
They're good to know and I recommend it since you already know relational algebra, you'll easily understand it but for the sole purposes of MIT web.lab and 6.170 we're good with just a normal
forms review. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's generally 6 normal forms, most common is 3NF/Boyce-Codd Normal Form(BCNF).</li>
<li>1NF (first normal form) is a single table with atomic attributes</li>
<li>The 4+ normal forms are rare, information theory forms
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By default you usually end up in 3NF</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>1NF</b>: All types must be atomic, no repeating groups
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>can't have multiple values in columns</li>
<li>shouldn't repeat groups (customer-name1, customer-name2)</li>
<li>array types are actually valid, but from a theoretical standpoint this violates 1NF</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>2NF</b>: Everything must be atomic, without repeating groups (1NF), but non-key attributes must depend on the candidate key
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Removing more redundancy</li>
<li>Considered 'good enough form'</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BCNF and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless-Join_Decomposition">lossless joins</a> will make no sense since we didn't cover superkeys by skipping lecture 4
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>'decomposition' means splitting a relation (table) into other relations</li>
<li>There's problems with BCNF anyway and you don't want to use it</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>3NF</b>: Preserved dependencies but may have some redundant data 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As an amateur you'll probably just naturally produce 3NF</li>
<li>Prof Pavlo claims nobody actually designs a db schema this way (calculating normal forms)</li>
<li>You end up thinking in terms of objects
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NoSQL drop all data protections (no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He argues mongoDB is still 1NF but with an array</li>
<li>Document data model (NoSQL) blurs line between logical and physical layer
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Problems: you end up now specifying the physical layout of data, no longer declaration model</li>
<li>All the problems of the 1970s (System R) returns that were talked about in prev lectures</li>
<li>System R was abandoned, too impossible to maintain</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Writing your queries in a declarative way is the 'best of both worlds' because the dbms will make the most efficient decision. The takeaway
from these lectures is: use Postgres (or sqlite3 latest version for small embedded dbms), it's the dbms that most conforms to the SQL standard, use CTEs, unless you have a specific model that requires the document data model (NoSQL).

Let's try the sqlite3 assignment from this <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/homework1/">homework</a>. Note make sure you get the latest sqlite3 version so you can use features such as window functions. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Q2: List the longest title of each type, along with the running time, use the primary title ASC as a tie-breaker.</li>
<li>We'll need a window function for this, since we want to rank, that way we get back all rankings that are 1 for each type</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
SELECT type, primary_title, runtime_minutes from ( 
 SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY type ORDER BY runtime_minutes DESC, primary_title ASC) 
  AS rank FROM titles) AS ranking WHERE ranking.rank = 1;

You don't have to write sql in all caps, it's just so the reader can understand more clearly what's going on. Try removing the primary title ASC out of the PARTITION BY and change ranking.rank to 2. Notice there are a lot of tvEpisodes rows returned
all with 720mins running time. A tie-breaker is what you decide should be returned in a situation like this, and we were asked to use ascending primary title as tie breaker meaning alphabetical sort, choose the first result.

As the date of this writing (Sep 8) I just helped finish somebody's homework since the solutions haven't been posted yet, though mine seems horribly inefficient and you could also do Q2 with JOIN. 
Working through and figuring out these few exercises will definitely help you learn the basics of SQL. The rest of that course can be completed if you <a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/#orgd3f0250">take</a> something like CMU's 15-213 or MIT 6.004 to learn about mmap, OS signals, etc.

After detouring through SQL we're back at MIT's web lab. This is a guest lecture about ed-tech that's optional.
Interesting: MITx MicroMasters program in Data Science helps you with admittance to their PhD SES program (you still need
an undergrad unfortunately). The fastest and cheapest undergrad you can probably do which has regional accreditation
(national accreditation usually doesn't qualify) is likely <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/about/accreditation.html">WGU</a>, as you can audit the courses as fast as you want. 
However it's $7k USD/yr so you are paying ~$28k total for a piece of paper while essentially teaching yourself everything, with the added bonus
that you can work F/T and still complete the courses. 
</p>


<p>
Some other MIT specific things are talked about, like the firehose <a href="https://firehose.guide">guide</a> which can help you plan course loads. If you don't know already MIT has numerous

I just went through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q5YbOYCVr_jq90pKw-wxbuaekbxOjkxtTCnO8pbE9lQ/edit#slide=id.g4c50b6e478_0_262">slides</a> since I've already audited this open CMU <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/uicourse/05863fall18/schedule.html">course</a> with lectures/slides which will teach you the basics of wireframing and human
computer interaction. It's a bit overkill with topics like 'Contextual Inquiry Analysis' but much of the info in the slides is excellent, like designing for 
international audiences and exact instructions how to use tools like Balsamiq/InVision/PhotoShop though as per web.lab you can just do this with pencil/paper.
</p>

<p>
My criteria for design is not to use those awful bootstrap tablet style home pages or infinity scroll. In general I follow the advice of government
sites which have so-called <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">design systems</a> (Australia and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/design-and-ux/">NZ</a> have these too) that have put actual research into their designs over an entire population. Common sense design advice there like using
breadcrumbs, avoiding terrible, terrible infinity scroll, making everything dead simple to find etc. The UK design system is open licensed last time I checked,
and is straight forward Express/Node with their copy-paste CSS and front end features for assistive technology support (JAWS, ZoomText, NVDA etc), plus they maintain it so you don't have to. 
</p>

<p>
They include a <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/tutorials-and-examples">prototyping kit</a> though you would obviously want to change colors to avoid looking exactly like GOV.UK and you would want to design your overall
site API so a real designer could easily use it should you wish a unique looking site that also has a fallback capability for IE 11 screen readers.

We're back to the weblab workshop which begins around 36:00, we are cloning <a href="https://github.com/mit6148-workshops/hello-world-react.git">this</a> repository. Note, the student who runs the workshop is a U.S. Collegiate Top 5 competitive 
figure skater as well as F/T MIT engineering student, so if she has time to learn this curriculum, so do you.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Webpack hot module replacement is explained <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/">here</a> as it was glossed over in the lecture
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>never use this in production for obvious security reasons</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Git checkout stephalf will overwrite to their greetings, but you can still see how it hot reloads any new changes(alter and save app.js)</li>
<li>1:22:00 he comments on the gotcha in the 6.170 slides about ClassName vs Class in the html (you have to use ClassName)</li>
<li>this.setState() from 6.170 slides also covered since you can't directly edit state from another component</li>
</ul>

<p>
The rest of the workshop is the standard git reset &#x2013;hard, git checkout &lt;stages&gt;. React has beginner <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html">documentation</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-27">
<p>
We skipped the Facebook GraphQL lecture because there are no notes/recordings. GraphQL is a query language with syntax similar to JSON with a detailed <a href="https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/">spec</a>. A good free book about
it is <i>The Road to GraphQL</i> which is available <a href="https://github.com/the-road-to-graphql/the-road-to-graphql/tree/master/manuscript">here</a>. The same author wrote <i>The Road to React</i> and is also <a href="https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react/the-road-to-learn-react/tree/master/manuscript">free</a> as noted in the previous section. If you did those SQL lectures you can figure out GraphQL.

The definitive guide for these things is <i>The Web Application Hacker's Handbook</i> and the book
<i>The Tangled Web: A Guide to Security Modern Web Applications</i>. The first book you get a free copy of burpsuite, an old version of Wordpress or something, and you do the book
by working through it and attacking your sample server (which you should probably put behind credentials/firewall so bots don't automatically attack it). The second book will teach
you about how there's even risks in CSS parsing, the many pitfalls of generating HTML, cache poisoning and other problems you should be aware of.

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Advice from the slides:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>sanitize and escape all inputs</li>
<li>limit sessions, use multi-level sessions for critical requests like password changing (most sites req you to enter the old pw to create a new one)</li>
<li>assume all requests can be out-of-order and replayed/modified, check every request
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>UDP protocol is a good example, if attacker can reply faster, they win (DNS is UDP)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>encrypt cookies, use TLS</li>
<li>use prepared statements as in the db.query() example</li>
<li>form tokens to defeat CSRF</li>
<li>don't work around same origin policy and defeat your own mitigations</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
The slides recommend OWASP but it's a seriously disorganized, corporate driven org where most of the advice is either incomplete or outdated. 
Some of the <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries">security cheat sheets</a> are OK such as the Top 10 but you'll be lost if you look into any of their articles on security. The book <i>The Tangled Web</i> ends each chapter with a checklist to follow if you're building an application and
is probably still the best resource for timeless general advice, which mitigates some of <a href="https://blog.georgovassilis.com/2016/04/16/advanced-web-security-topics/">these</a> attacks. There's plenty of security-as-a-service <a href="https://www.sqreen.com/">startups</a> around too with their own <a href="https://www.sqreen.com/checklists/saas-cto-security-checklist">checklists</a> and <a href="https://github.com/quarantyne/quarantyne">web app firewalls</a>.

<h4 id="orgb736998"><span class="section-number-4">28.3.1</span> Reputation, regulatory and maniac proofing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-28-3-1">
<p>
Not covered anywhere is security of your reputation from fake reviews, overzelous regulators or maniacs who may target you. 
</p>

<p>
Reputation security can be defined as protecting yourself from fake reviews on various ratings sites and Google, and protection from negative PR being spread about you on social media. This is something to think
about when designing your site/service: how will you defeat an organized attempt (likely by your competitors) from attempting to damage your reputation. You will want to be proactive here to not let an attack continue for too long
where there are hundreds of bad reviews and PR floating around before you've noticed. For example look at some of the Google Playstore reviews, there is salon software where a large percentage of bad reviews are being angry against some hairdresser 
that's using it, nothing to do with the software, driving down the reputation of that app with no response from the developers. Unless you actually went through numerous reviews you'd never know they weren't related to the software.
</p>


<p>
Regulatory security is protection from a patent troll suing you, or competitors making complaints to some authority. At least be aware of these and ways you may be targeted. For example the domain you choose, the TLD owners may have conditions or restrictions and end up pulling your domain after complaints.
To avoid patent trolls, incorporate a limited liability company before you launch, and do some kind of research into the design of your site. For example you probably don't know that there's an active patent troll who sues exchange websites that have a design where the highest bid converges with the highest ask in a single column. This is why
you always see these seperated.   
</p>

<p>
Finally maniac proofing. Ways to design around maniacs, think about petty sabotage. For example we'll use salon software again.
Suppose you're writing an app for appointments or reservations. Do you have a plan to mitigate somebody making a hundred fake reservations everyday? Filling the support queue with garbage? Doing dozens of chargebacks? Have you even 
considered how you will mitigate chargebacks? Is there a social feature such as comments allowed on your site, will you shadowban or outright ban? Shadowban being the maniac is allowed to continue posting but their comments and posts
only show on their end to attempt to fool them into thinking they're just being ignored so they go away eventually to seek attention elsewhere. An outright ban you are letting them know they need to go and use VPNs and other workarounds to continue
shitposting on your website. The only advice I can think of is as you build something architect your application so sabotaging it cannot be easy to do, such as allowing somebody to fill a day's appointments with fake clients. This doesn't mean you need to be paranoid, just make it hard for a single troll to kill your app.

<p>
27:06, pause the lecture and actually sketch a data model for the URL shortner. Note where the slides instruct:
'design what data is stored, now how'. My terribad model consists of group for private shorts, owner, date, shortcode, URL, some kind of flag that determines when it should expire, 
probably a list of words we don't want to be used as a short code, probably a list of URLs we don't want used such as infamous <i>Last Measure</i> URL.

<li>At 14:56 "The labels of a conversation are the union of it's messages". If you remember relational set theory from the SQL lectures, what this means is every distinct message label inside that conversation becomes the conversation label.</li>

<li>Alloy use here is a 'representation invariant', meaning a way to more strongly type the data model</li>
<li>Deriving a schema from the model:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is it a primitive value? If no add attributes</li>
<li>Assign types (string, date, int) to each attribute or primitive value</li>
<li>Reverse relations that point from one to 'many' to a single thing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Example given, each shortcut will have one user/owner whereas a user can have many shortcuts so flip the relation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Break graph into trees which will be the tables</li>
<li>The tree root becomes the key of the table, sets without primitive types become ids (integer indexes)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Corner cases: many to many
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Just create a relation that combines both into a table</li>

<li>Subsets:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>split up tables to keep immutables together</li>
<li>possible to add redundancy, to avoid having to do joins</li>

I was actually surprised how easy it was to derive a complete schema, though the odds of me getting the abstract data model correct
are pretty low. This is just something we'll have to <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/courseMaterial/topics/topic5/lectureNotes/R7__Data_Models___Schema_Translation/R7__Data_Models___Schema_Translation.pdf">practice</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-33">
<p>
This is an interesting 2 lecture series that finishes the design process. 
</p>

<p>
The first 50 minutes are UX criteria:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>learnability, how easy is your system to figure out without any documentation</li>
<li>efficiency, does this work for power users</li>
<li>error tolerance</li>
<li>pleasantness</li>
<li>safety</li>
<li>security</li>
<li>accessibility</li>
</ul>

<p>
The complete design process in brief:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>come up with idea/product purposes 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>invent concept purpose</li>
<li>review known concepts</li>
<li>polish concept design (1 to 1 mapping of concept to purpose)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>design the UI
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>review known elements/UI</li>
<li>apply heuristic eval</li>
</ul></li>
<li>testing</li>
</ul>

<p>
Heuristics (methods):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>physical level: fitt's law 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keep features close/large</li>
</ul></li>
<li>perceptual fusion: avoid delays &gt; 0.1s, or show progress bar</li>
<li>use visual layout to convey structure (grouping and mapping)</li>
<li>language: use simple/specific terms
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>consistent naming and icons</li>
<li>don't require memorization</li>
</ul></li>
<li>information 'scent': allow user to easily navigate themselves</li>
<li>navigation:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>make user's state/location visible (breadcrumbs)</li>
<li>accelerators: make it fast to reuse common features, minimize steps to them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>provide undo/cancel actions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>feedback: when you do something let the user know what they've done</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Surprisingly they don't use <a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">https://www.lingscars.com/</a> as an example of UX. A good example of dark patterns talked about is the site this website is hosted on.
When you log in and look at the options, 'Buy Domain' is offered: "We offer a growing selection of domains". After purchasing one,
it redirects you back to this site with the error: "This feature isn't available". If you attempt to use the contact form it gives you an error saying you
must 'contact us from an email associated with your account' then helpfully doesn't present any addresses to email.

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The weblab.to links are to a codepen page which no longer works but you can edit CSS directly in
Chrome/FireFox to do this workshop. We've already done most of this in the 6.170 course and the CSS standard we looked through. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Layouts: display
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A site for this exists: learnlayout.com (no CSS grid however)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>display: determines how elements size and sit with/in each other</li>
<li>display: inline is porportional to text size</li>
<li>display: inline-block can have it's own size</li>
<li>display: flex we've already covered, justify-content we used in the 6.170 recitations</li>
<li>display: grid we've already seen too</li>
<li>Layouts: position</li>
<li>position: static renders boxes position based on order in document (default value for divs)</li>
<li>position: relative slight modifications in position</li>
<li>position: absolute for navbars or sidebars (or use grid)</li>
<li>position: fixed relative to the screen (navbar)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Never use float, grid/flexbox exists instead</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transitions: start/end
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Color changes, position changes, auto or display won't work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Animations
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>use @keyframes to define a cycle</li>
<li>predefined selectors such as :hover :selected :active to trigger animation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Responsive Layouts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>media queries, we saw these in the stripe.com example where they had different CSS for different devices</li>
<li>they use the weblab.mit.edu site as an example of responsive, but on the schedule page all the youtube and slide links disappear if you're on a standard mobile screensize</li>
<li>in the 2018 lecture they note FireFox and Chrome inspector have responsive tools you can use to see your page layout on a smaller screen</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Interesting lecture where we learned some animations and transitions, the MDN docs cover all this and which browser your CSS effect will work in. Sadly
IE11 still exists and doesn't even fully support flexbox IIRC, and there's millions of devices out there running outdated android browsers. 
</p>


<p>
A reminder that flexbox is what you use for an unknown amount of items you want to organize in a single row or column like a toolbar with buttons. 
Flexbox doesn't have grid-gap on most browsers, so you need to use the margin hack like we saw in the lecture whereas with CSS grid this is easy to do.
You would use CSS grid for overall page layout of header, footer, box over here, navbar over here, or like how we saw with stripe.com where they used it
for background design of colored stripes. Responsive design with grid is dead simple. There's a good stackexchange answer <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/55073039">here</a> on where you would want flexbox instead of grid, but keep in mind the next spec of CSS grid
covers some of these problems such as creating space between the first and last items. That and there exists a ton of flexbox CSS frameworks like <a href="https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/">spectre</a>.

Before we continue with web.lab's react workshop, <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld">here</a> is the 'mother of all demo apps' in almost every web framework if you want to see what a real world app looks
like in framework of choice. If you are wondering why there are so many frameworks, it's because new ECMAScript (ES) features were not available cross-browser, so we needed frameworks in order to use the new ES standard features, and for security reasons, however in 2019 most browsers support all these new features and you
could, if you really paid attention to the security lectures (and the book <i>Tangled Web</i>), write everything in vanilla JS w/CSS grid and every browser that matters will support it, with some exceptions for the ancient IE screenreaders you would have to deal with. That is until <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uxbDh4uONFQOiGuiumlJBLGgO4KDWB8ZEkp7Rd47fw4/edit">layoutNG</a> shows up since subgrids new proposal wasn't implemented by any browser except Firefox.

The most enjoyable front-end web development I've done is definitely with ClojureScript, because like Common Lisp you can interactively <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/#lisp-as-a-system">program</a> as seen in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZjFVdU8VLI">example</a>. If you dislike these frameworks, dislike having to rebuild your app because of breaking updates every X months, and dislike the bugs of webpack then try a <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/">book</a> on clojure/emacs, and some kind of tutorial for <a href="https://reagent-project.github.io/">reagent</a> or <a href="http://funcool.github.io/clojurescript-unraveled/">ClojureScript</a> documentation. That said everything you have done up to this point is needed to understand ClojureScript or any kind of web development anyway so you didn't waste your time.

</ul>

<p>
"In React, we structure our code based on what the user interface looks like". If you did the 6.170 lectures on Conceptual design and UX then this part
of the React design phase will be easy to do. These React workshops are a little confusing, what you mainly need is the overall architecture idea
of properties (props) being passed down. If you like React you can pick up any book on React like <i>Pro React</i>, latest edition, and it will review everything we've done here but at with more
detail of what Super(props) is doing and how components are designed, why there is piles of 'this' keywords, how the router works (you could rewrite Router yourself in under 50 lines of code, if
you don't like their implementation). These workshops build up competence too, after you see all the answers and pass stage 1, git reset back to the beginning and reimplement them yourself all over again. If you still
don't understand just keep following the workshops (there's 3 of them), you'll eventually pick this up.

</ul>

<p>
We're cloning <a href="https://github.com/mit6148-workshops/snake-react.git">same</a> repository as last time, starting with the branch day2-starter
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>grid length is declared in config.js if you're wondering</li>
<li>Array.from is documented <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from">here</a> note she added .keys() to it for use as an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/keys">iterator</a> 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reminder that everything in the map function is repeated for each cell, so 30x</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Could also write it like this if you want to see the sequence more clearly:
</p>

<pre class="example">
{
Array
.from(Array(GRID_LENGTH)
.keys()
.map(x =&gt; &lt;Cell .... /&gt;))
}
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The key ID in the gameboard.js row render() is just y because we're counting y-axis rows 0-29 whereas cells is x-axis and could end up with non unique keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rest of this workshop is standard git reset &#x2013;hard, git checkout next stage and fill in missing code. Slowly you are getting an idea of how React.js works.

<h2 id="orge4bfcd9"><span class="section-number-2">38</span> [web.lab] Deployment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-38">
<p>
Get a recent book on DevOps from libgen.is to see how it's done 'at scale', get a <a href="https://nostarch.com/catalog/linux-bsd-unix">book</a> that covers <a href="https://debian-handbook.info/">system administration</a> and read about web security and priv seperation <a href="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2019/schedule.html">here</a>. 
Rent a fixed price VPS, a cheap dedicated server or deploy your own colocated rack somewhere and avoid having to pay huge amounts of pay-per-use fees in the beginning.  
</p>

<p>
I skipped the lecture 'How to Deploy' because it's just a Heroku walkthrough, and I recommend you don't ever use Heroku since it goes from free tier to costs a ton of money tier very quickly. 
For the purposes of the MIT competition it's fine since only the class will be using it but if you were to launch a public app billing can get out of control. There is free so-called serverless hosting
such as zeit.co where you can push static assets direct to their CDN. There is also Google Firebase which has a fixed price monthly plan. There exists a ton of React tutorials for using Firebase as a backend. 
Just be aware Google has a history of surprise product EOL and you also become dependent to vendor lock in with any kind of serverless or Firebase hosting plan. That said it's not easy to maintain a server every single day and keep on top of
security patches, and fine tune performance problems. My preference for deploying a large amount of servers and maintaining them is <a href="http://guix.gnu.org/">Guix System</a>. You write one declarative file
on how you want to configure the server, and replicate that exact server X times. It has numerous docker like features too so you can invoke guix environment and create
a container that just contains your app dependencies. My other preference for a single server would be a BSD, because they are simple to grok and well documented how to configure and deploy. OpenBSD is especially easy to use, with it's own webserver. 
Do you have extra time to configure and maintain all of this yourself? If not then paying for something like Heroku or locking yourself into Firebase/Zeit/AWS Lambda may be what's right for you.  
</p>

<p>
Another option if you're going the colocation route, and you need a lot of concurrent connections is using Elixir and <a href="https://github.com/happi/theBeamBook">BEAM</a>. Elixir has it's own webserver (Phoenix) which has channels for real-time features. There's numerous books on Elixir web development. 
An auction site would be easy to implement using Elixir/Phoenix in fact there's papers on Google scholar detailing how to implement this (in Erlang, which is trivial to adapt to Elixir). A trading bot, or an exchange website would also be a perfect candidate for Phoenix/Elixir though significant security architecture built 
in order to handle the actual exchanging of assets which is well beyond the scope of this workshop. If you ever decide to do this, the proper way is to bootstrap your exchange with insurance: some public 3rd party who is trusted holds X amount of coins, and your exchange will not accept above that amount. As your exchange grows you dump profits into the insurance, to gradually 
expand daily limits. That way if disaster strikes you aren't left holding an empty bag, and people can trust you from the very beginning so essentially bootstrapping a reputation.

The 2018 <a href="http://webdevelopment.mit.edu/2018/lectures">schedule</a> has these recordings, there's a good one on Postgres (from an Oracle guy of all people) though covers some of what we already know from the CMU relational dbms lectures, and the React native Bloomberg lecture. The machine learning lecture if you're interested
you can learn practical machine learning/visualization <a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/#org66d9fc3">here</a> and from Cornell's practical machine learning <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/lectures/index.html">course</a> which assumes you've completed a seperate course on <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs053/current/lectures.htm">Linear Algebra</a>.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lecture for code quality starts at 57:20</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Avoid magic numbers
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a magic number is a number not assigned to a variable in code that does not have an immediate and clear meaning</li>
<li>snake-react we used a constant to assign grid length = 30 instead of using '30' everywhere
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a timer function with a number isn't magic because it's meaning is immediately clear whereas injecting '30' into those react workshop functions is magic</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Style:</li>
<li>good style helps prevent bugs</li>
<li>AirBnB JavaScript Style <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">guide</a></li>
<li>linters also exist, many have the AirBnB style already as a ruleset
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>some editors (emacs) this can be checked in real time as you type</li>
</ul></li>
<li>'Don't use git like an ape' forcing push, not checking status before adding.</li>
<li>Debugging:</li>
<li>write tests/examples before writing functions. We barely covered any <a href="https://jestjs.io/">testing</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>go through the slides <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1320/lectures.html">here</a> on interface testing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>every function should just have one task</li>
<li>run and test often to avoid having to debug huge amounts of code</li>
<li>never cut + paste, you will miss bugs and propogate them around your code whereas if you retyped it, you'd catch the bug
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>many famous examples that persisted for years because of repeated cut+paste</li>
</ul></li>
<li>sometimes reading the code backwards helps as your brain tends to fill in small typos</li>
<li>read the error message in in the console</li>
<li>if your editor has a javascript mode, and your automatic indentation isn't working you forgot to close something</li>
<li>Chrome/FireFox dev console has a debugger to set breakpoints</li>
</ul>

Lecture goes up to this point then they skip the rest of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZYmtGxNW8lFJV4JxjMw15rffTC29WbJJ3tJzFUGg6rg/edit#slide=id.g2f05ea9596_0_0">slides</a> but the summary is: code in small chunks, make incremental changes, if you write hacky junk just to get
some feature working write a comment so you can go back later, don't overthink code organization. Note this is for the competition, which they have a week to finish a MVP.

Try these <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2019fa/textbook/">notes</a> on programming in OCaml, there exists a way take compiled OCaml code and produce <a href="https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/3.1.0/manual/overview">js</a>.

An interesting MVP is the JStreet <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/incr_dom">incremental Dom</a> influenced by the <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/">ELM</a> architecture. webAssembly is an MVP still, things like dom manipulation need to be handled with inline js if using EMSCRIPTEN and c/<a href="http://aop.cs.cornell.edu/">c++</a> or writing in Rust.
